### Testing counter
to test the counter module i wrote a test program called conterstest.c to explore the capabilities of the counter data structure. 

My program countertest.c tests each method described in my counters.h file and tests the boundary cases and difference cases.

### Test run

you can run `make test` command to test it out and see the output
